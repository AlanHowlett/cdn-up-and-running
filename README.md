# CDN Up and Running (WIP)

The objective of this post is to build a body of knowledge on how CDNs work by coding one from "scratch". The CDN, we're going to architect, uses nginx, lua, docker, docker-compose, Prometheus, grafana, and wrk.

We'll start creating a single backend example service and expand from there to a multi-node, latency simulated, observable, and testable CDN. In each section, there are discussions around the challenges and trade-offs of building/managing/operating a CDN.

## What is a CDN?

A Content Delivery Network is a set of computers, spatially distributed, tasked to provide high availability, **better performance** for systems that can have their **work cached** on this network.

## Why do you need a CDN?

A CDN can help to improve:
* faster loading times (smoother streaming, instant page to buy, quick friends feed, etc)
* accommodate traffic spikes (black friday, popular streaming release, breaking news, etc)
* decrease costs (traffic offloading)
* scalability for millions

## How does a CDN work?

CDNs are able to make the services faster by placing the content (a media file, page, javascript, a json response, etc) closer to the users.

When a user wants to consume a service, the CDN routing system will deliver the "best" node where the content is likely already cached, and closer to the client. Don't worry about the loose use of the word best in here. I hope that throughout the reading, the understanding of what is the best node will be better defined.

## The CDN stack

The CDN will rely on:
* Linux/GNU/Kernel - a kernel / operating system with outstanding networking capabilities as well as IO excellence.
* Nginx - an excellent web server that can be used as a reverse proxy providing caching ability.
* Lua - a simple powerful language to add features into nginx.
* Prometheus - A system with a dimensional data model, flexible query language, efficient time series database.
* Grafana - The open source analytics & monitoring
* Containers - technology to package, deploy, and isolate applications, we'll use docker and docker compose.
